# wgpu-native-ocaml Progress

## 2026-01-25: Rust/Cargo Integration Complete

### Accomplished
- Set up dune build rule to compile wgpu-native via Cargo
- The rule correctly navigates from the dune sandbox to the real source tree
- Successfully produces `libwgpu_native.a` (256MB static library)
- Library links correctly with OCaml code

### Verified Working
- Minimal test executable creates and releases a wgpu Instance
- No memory errors or crashes
- `dune build @check` passes with no warnings

### Files Changed
- `low/dune`: Added Cargo build rule, foreign_archives, c_library_flags
- `high/dune`: Added dependency on wgpu_low
- `codegen/gen_bindings.ml`: Updated to generate minimal working C stubs and OCaml bindings
- `test/test_compute.ml`: Added Instance creation/release test

### Next Steps
1. Begin implementing YAML parser for webgpu.yml
2. Define IR (intermediate representation) types
3. Generate enum types from specification
